Requires at least: 3.1
Tested up to: 3.2.1
Stable tag: 0.0.4

A high-quality, well coded, fast loading theme designed as a base for new themes.

== Description ==

Essence is designed to be modular and easy to extend.  It does not do everything,
but what it does it does well and what it does not do can be added with a plugin.
The plan is to have a whole suite of essence plugins that can be used to add
functionality without making the theme too large and cumbersome.  It should just
do what you want and nothing more.
